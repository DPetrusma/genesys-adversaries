		"description": "The first high-atmospheric air-speeder to be classified as a cloud car, the Storm IV was built by Bespin Motors for use by Cloud City's Bespin Wing Guard. Designed as a fast patrol and interdiction craft, the Storm IV is a sturdy, reliable airspeeder composed of two single-occupant armored pods joined by a central spar. The port side pod holds the pilot and is equipped with a number of sophisticated sensors and an advanced navigation system. The starboard pod holds the craft's gunner along with the targeting and fire-control computers. While the Storm IV isn't equipped with the advanced life support systems found in starfighters or other spacecraft, each pod is pressurized and provides oxygen for the kinds of high-altitude work for which the craft was built. Along with their individual sensor suites, both the pilot and gunner have a 360-degree field of view through the heavy transparisteel canopies that top each cockpit and along with the sensors, give them unparalleled visibility in flight. While Storm IVs are typically used in patrol and interdiction roles, they can also be used in more martial roles to provide air support for law enforcement.",
