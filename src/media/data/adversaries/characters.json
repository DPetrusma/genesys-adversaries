If it looks as though the fight is going against them, they might well call out to the PCs for assistance, for they realize how dangerous Thamoss can be (despite Corte’s earlier assurances that this job would be simple and risk-free).",

Rather than use his power to better his kingdom, Maalva lines his own pockets and blames the lack of prosperity on the Empire, the Hutts, and a bad roll of the chance cube.\n\nKing Maalva tolerates the Imperials by order of his Hutt overlords, but he also has gained personal ben­efit from their presence. Unbeknownst to his subjects and even his councilmen, the king orders the abduc­tion of Toydarian villagers in far-flung settlements and sells them into Imperial slavery. In return, Maalva is paid handsomely, and starships bearing the royal seal are exempt from all customs inspections.",
