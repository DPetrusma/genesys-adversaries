Though they are widely thought to be extinct like the Jedi they once hunted, it is rumored that a few Morgukai persist and practice their art in secret.",

The few who survived the hard labor and prolonged exposure to Nar Shaddaa’s atmosphere retreated to the moon’s lower levels. There, centuries of pollution exposure and inbreeding have led to their becoming a wracked and sickly species.",
