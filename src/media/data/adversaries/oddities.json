Gregarious, clever, and sharply observant, they can prove to be a valuable source of obscure information. However, many Besalisks hide their own agenda beneath their genial demeanor, and those who interact with them would do well to remember it.",

Professional soldiers for hire, Chiss mercenaries are too few to be found together in numbers; one can rarely find more than a single Chiss in an entire star system.",
