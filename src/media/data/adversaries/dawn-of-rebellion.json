Eventually, they seek the surface and wander the coral.\n\nOnce they find an appropriate location, dokma shed their shell and latch onto surface coral like a barnacle. There, they are able to siphon sustenance from the coral, grow, and create a new shell. After a dokma’s new shell is complete, it migrates to a new coral formation, seeking a mate. If it is successful, the pair locates a sub-surface lake to host their offspring, otherwise, the dokma continues wandering the surface and watching for hungry krykna.",

Their tail and flight strength are greater than they appear: three convorees can lift predators as large as a momong with enough effort. On Atollon, they have mysteriously appeared alongside Bendu. They have also been sighted on Malachor and other worlds in conjunction with Force-related occurrences.\n\nConvorees are popular as pets, particularly on Kiros, where they have a unique, gold-plumed convor breed. Some owners train them as hunting birds. Perhaps more so than other cultures, the Togruta once placed symbolic significance on convorees. Ancient heroes in Togruta mythological writings saw these creatures as reincarnations of deceased ancestors sent to guide the living in times of need. Togruta funerals often culminate in the presentation of a convor hatchling to the bereaved family.",
