He supported several deployments and served at the Battle of Ryloth. When the Galactic Empire came to power, it deemed AP-5 obsolete and reassigned him to a bulk freight as quartermaster. Many years after the Clone Wars, a now depressed and irritable AP-5 befriended fellow Clone Wars veteran Chopper, Phoenix Cell's astromech droid.\n\nAfter some convincing, AP-5 accepted Chopper's invitation to join Phoenix Cell. Finally fulfilling his primary programming again, AP-5's cross-referenced Imperial, Republic, and Lasat astrogation charts to determine a safe haven for Phoenix Cell, deciding on Atollon. His brave actions saved Chopper's friends, and as a result, AP-5 was given the role as Chopper Base's quartermaster where his logistical expertise helps bring order to the often chaotic supply situation at the base. He also provides Commander Sato with intelligence analysis. While AP-5 has never felt better, his gratitude expresses itself as dry insults and biting sarcasm.",

While it shares a similar appearance and a limited ability to create webbing, the krykna possesses only six limbs and cannot generate venom. Its vertically-orientated body is pale and fleshy, but surprisingly resistant to blaster fire. The creature's terrifying visage features two large, glassy black eyes atop a beaked mouth flanked by twitching mandibles.\n\nKrykna thrive and lay eggs within the tunnels in and under the massive rocky coral growths covering Atollon's surface. They only venture out to search for food, subsisting on skittish dokma snails, though the krykna are willing to dine on anything that stinks of fear. Far from invincible, krykna have an intense aversion to the radiation emitted from standard sensor markers, allowing base personnel to erect an invisible barricade that keeps them out.",

The dokma life cycle is one of constant migration. Born in underwater aquifers, dokma shed their first shell after weeks of drinking the mineral-rich subterranean waters. Eventually, they seek the surface and wander the coral.\n\nOnce they find an appropriate location, dokma shed their shell and latch onto surface coral like a barnacle. There, they are able to siphon sustenance from the coral, grow, and create a new shell. After a dokma's new shell is complete, it migrates to a new coral formation, seeking a mate. If it is successful, the pair locates a sub-surface lake to host their offspring, otherwise, the dokma continues wandering the surface and watching for hungry krykna.",

Their short, plump, feathered bodies end in a long, prehensile tail. The creatures hunt alone or in groups of two or three. Their tail and flight strength are greater than they appear: three convorees can lift predators as large as a momong with enough effort. On Atollon, they have mysteriously appeared alongside Bendu. They have also been sighted on Malachor and other worlds in conjunction with Force-related occurrences.\n\nConvorees are popular as pets, particularly on Kiros, where they have a unique, gold-plumed convor breed. Some owners train them as hunting birds. Perhaps more so than other cultures, the Togruta once placed symbolic significance on convorees. Ancient heroes in Togruta mythological writings saw these creatures as reincarnations of deceased ancestors sent to guide the living in times of need. Togruta funerals often culminate in the presentation of a convor hatchling to the bereaved family.",
