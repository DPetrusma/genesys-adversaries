The Emperor's Hands operate in absolute secrecy, often sent on missions by the Emperor himself. Members of the Emperor's Hands almost invariably possess Force abilities and the will to use them.",

		"type": "Nemesis",
		"description": "The Jedi are an ancient order whose light has essentially disappeared from the galaxy. As far as the vast majority of the galaxy is concerned, the Jedi are extinct and their ancient ways were prone to treachery and failure. This is what the Empire has told the people of the galaxy and many believe it. The truth, while not far from the story, is not entirely the same. A handful of Jedi survived the purge that accompanied the birth of the Empire. Most died in subsequent years, but a few remain in hiding. And there are a few whom the Empire never bothered to hunt. Those who fall into this last category are haunted by their failures and by the fact that they are not even enough of a threat to warrant the Empire’s attention. Most have succumbed to self-pity and vice of one form or another If they do not already embrace the dark side, they are not far from doing so.",

		"description": "The Jedi Order did not survive the birth of the Galactic Empire. The entire order has been painted by Imperial propaganda as a collection of traitors, fools, and lunatics, and many within the modern Empire accept these statements as truth. Outlawed holovids and banned texts tell a different story, frequently portraying the Jedi as heroes. These fictional accounts would have one believe that innumerable Jedi survived the purge conducted by the Empire, but in truth fewer than one hundred of the thousands of Jedi survived. The majority of those who did were hunted and killed shortly thereafter by Darth Vader and the Imperial forces under his command. The Alliance would desperately like to believe that there are Jedi in hiding who escaped the purge and might join the Rebels in their struggle. Unfortunately, little evidence has been found to support this theory other than a few former Padawans who have joined their ranks.",
