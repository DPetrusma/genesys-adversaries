		"description": "The Jedi are an ancient order whose light has essentially disappeared from the galaxy. As far as the vast majority of the galaxy is concerned, the Jedi are extinct and their ancient ways were prone to treachery and failure. This is what the Empire has told the people of the galaxy and many believe it. The truth, while not far from the story, is not entirely the same. A handful of Jedi survived the purge that accompanied the birth of the Empire. Most died in subsequent years, but a few remain in hiding. And there are a few whom the Empire never bothered to hunt. Those who fall into this last category are haunted by their failures and by the fact that they are not even enough of a threat to warrant the Empireâ€™s attention. Most have succumbed to self-pity and vice of one form or another If they do not already embrace the dark side, they are not far from doing so.",
