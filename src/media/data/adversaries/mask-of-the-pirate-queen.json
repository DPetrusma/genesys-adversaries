This behaviour is instinctual, as Corellian bloodhounds in the wild rely on stealth to ambush their prey. At up to one meter in length, Corellian blooodhounds are slim and agile, relying on stealth and speed rather than brute strength to take down prey.

As he traveled the galaxy, avoiding the stream of bounty hunters sent looking for him, he grew increasingly addicted to gambling. Fortunately, he had a knack for sabacc. Much of his success stemmed from his latent Force abilities, which even he is unaware of. Though he eventually settled down on Ord Mantell, Micael doesn't intend to remain there for much longer.

Micael is a handsome man with black hair and blue eyes who looks much younger than his forty-two years. He dresses in fashionable clothes, and though not a fighter, he carries at least two holdout blasters. He is incredibly charming, and has little trouble using his talents to further his own ends.",
