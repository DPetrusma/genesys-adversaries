She was moved to the Grand Army of the Republic for the duration of the Clone Wars, and she participated in the bombardment of Xorrn at the end of the conflict. She stayed on while the Republic became the Galactic Empire. After bearing witness to the subjugation of Rampa I, she resigned and went home to Gall.\n\nStruck by the ruin her hometown had become under Jans Coorsa’s leadership, Hardin became involved with clan politics and was quickly named patrician of the Hardin family. While she opposed Jans Coorsa at every decision, they shared a mutual respect. After the Imperial bombardment that decimated their village, Hardin convinced Coorsa to go into hiding on Xorrn. There, Hardin’s experience was invaluable in reactivating Foundry Four and creating the orbital repair yard. After Jans died, Hardin opposed his grandson, who sought higher·profile clients, particularly the Rebellion.",

A number of years later, a local crime lord hired some of the Mandalorian mercenaries at Arumorut to eliminate Nok’s operation.

When the blaster bolts start flying, he often sits back at first, finding the weak point in the enemy’s strategy. Once the enemy notices him, he charges and attacks like a man expecting to die.
