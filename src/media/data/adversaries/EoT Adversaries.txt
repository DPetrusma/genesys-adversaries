Atronach, Fire [Minion]
Elemental Daedra, commonly known as Atronachs, are highly intelligent daedra often most often summoned by conjurers. They have no kinship or loyalties with any of the Daedric Princes, and serve all of them as they please.

Fire Atronachs are considered the most plentiful and common, and perhaps weakest of the Atronachs. Resembling slender armoured Mer, their flesh is instead a raging flame, which turns to ash upon their demise. They posses a fierce, primal hatred with Frost Atronachs, with whom they often wage war against.

Atronach, Frost [Rival]
Frost Atronachs are less common, but more imposing to mortals than their fiery rivals. Their form varies, typically depending on the intelligence of the individual Daedra. Some will resemble nothing more than an amalgamation of icy shards, while others resemble men made of ice. They share the Fire Atronach’s hatred, often responding to their threats with action.

Banekin [Minion]
The smallest of all Daedric minions, Banekin resemble miniscule scamps. While they lack size and strength, Banekin seem to have a natural affinity for Shock magic, wielding more magic than the average lesser Daedra. This makes them easy to dispatch, but fairly lethal.

Due to their great speed and considerable strength, they are fearsome opponents, especially to weaker travellers. All clannfears rely upon melee attacks using their heads, beaks, and/or claws.

Cultist [Minion]
Every Daedric Prince, Aedra, and even some mortals have cults dedicated to them. The members of these cults are tenacious, dedicated, and in some cases ruthless. This cultist profile should be used as a baseline for any cultists, with their highest and lowest attributes traded depending on their patron. (i.e. Personality for Sanguine, or Strength for Boethiah). Skills and equipment can stay the same.

Dark Seducers
Possessing dusky blue-grey skin, full figured, voluptuous forms, and very little armour to cover them, the Dark Seducers stop resembling their namesake when spoken to. Perhaps as part of some cruel joke on the part of their creator Sheogorath, Dark Seducers (in stark contrast to their alluring appearance) are aggressive, dismissive and arrogant Daedra in service to the Mad God.

Called the Mazken in their own tongue, the Dark Seducers act as the military for one half of Sheogorath’s split.. Well.. Everything. In constant rivalry with the Golden Saints who also serve their Lord, Mazken are ever eager to prove themselves capable. And they regularly succeed in that cause.

A matriarchal society, some male Mazken do exist, though they are looked down upon by their female superiors, and rarely, if ever, hold positions of power.
Dark Seducer, Kiskengo [Minion]
The rank and file of the Mazken forces, Kiskengos are rarely seen outside of the Shivering Isles, and as such few mortals are aware that Dark Seducers are anything but the more powerful, better trained Mazken typically encountered on Mundus.

Dark Seducer, Autkendo [Rival]
What cultists and adventurers are more likely to meet is an Autkendo. A mid-level Mazken Sergeant, Autkendos are well trained, well equipped and powerful. Sheogorath often sends them to Mundus to perform errands, and allows them to be summoned.

Dark Seducer, Grakendo [Nemesis]
The Generals and Lords of the Mazken forces, Grakendos answer only to the Mad God himself. Having earned their position by climbing a ladder of merit (And a ladder filled with immortals), Grakendos are incredibly powerful, fierce, and well equipped. If an adventurer somehow earns the ire of a Grakendo, they had best be prepared to run.

Dremora
Dremora are Daedra of above average size, typically appearing with black-and-red faces, and sometimes small stubs of horns. They are fully sentient and most are powerful warriors or spellcasters. They are the most powerful and intelligent of the lesser daedra, to the point of governing over other daedra on behalf of their Lord. Higher-ranking Dremora are often larger in physique than a Nord male. Dremora are always heavily armored and even the spellcaster's robes provide heavy armor protection.

Dremora are one of the rare species of Daedra which are not only sentient, but capable of human speech. Unlike other sentient species, such as Golden Saints or Dark Seducers, the Dremora primarily speak in their own language and use Nibenese only for taunting human opponents.
Dremora, Caitiff [Minion]
Typically used as rank and file in any Dremora outfit, Caitiffs are the lowest ranking of all Dremora, armed with simple Bound armour and weapons, and given basic training. Despite this, a Caitiff is a serious threat to a mortal combatant, and should not be taken lightly.

Golden Saints
The Aureal (or Aureals), more commonly known as Golden Saints, are Daedric humanoids who appear as men or half-clad women with golden-hued skin wearing golden armor and a winged helmet. They serve under the command of the Daedric Prince Sheogorath. Their home is Brellach in the Shivering Isles, but despite their name, they have little love for mortals. The Aureal are a proud, arrogant race, quick to anger and cruel in their punishment. There is no question that they view all others as inferior, and make no effort to hide this in their interactions.

They are a matriarchal society, tending to look down upon all males. Even male Golden Saints consider themselves and other males to be lesser. The Aureal make up one half of Sheogorath's army, along with the Mazken. The two groups have a great rivalry, each believing they are Sheogorath's favored. The Aureal are charged with guarding Mania.

Golden Saint, Auren [Minion]
Auren are the lowest ranking Aureal. Serving as rank and file, with the lowest grade equipment and training. Auren are rarely, if ever, seen outside of the Shivering Isles. Most males in Aureal society occupy this role.

Golden Saint, Pelaurig [Nemesis]
The great Generals and Lords of the Aureal, Pelaurig are adorned with the finest golden armour, weapons, and training. Having earned their position and desirous of keeping it, they refuse to be defeated in battle. Ever self-confident, and perhaps more arrogant than any other Aureals, Pelaurig are easy to anger, and easier to fall to.
