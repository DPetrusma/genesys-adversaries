Despite the increased security measures complicating her Senate life, she takes her role seriously and hopes to broker a peaceful end to conflict. She holds a seat on the Loyalist Committee, and fellow committee member Bail Organa is her closest ally in the Senate.",

He leads the Confederacy with the aid of his council of oligarchs, pushing back Republic incursions from what he spins as “violations of the sovereignty of independent systems.”\n\nCount Dooku is a master of lightsaber combat, once considered among the best duelists in the Jedi Order. As a Jedi, Dooku trained Qui-Gon Jinn to knighthood, and he credits Qui-Gon’s death on Naboo as his reason for leaving the order. Dooku has since reclaimed his birthright as Count of Serenno, inheriting a fortune. His wealth, coupled with his intense gravitas and natural charm, enabled him to recruit rich and powerful allies. When encountering other Jedi, Dooku claims to hunt a Sith Lord hidden within the Republic, but Dooku simultaneously displays dark powers, which he acquired after leaving the Jedi.",
