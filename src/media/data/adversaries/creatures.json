Overhunting led to rampant growth in the squall populations, which had negative impacts on Chandrilan crops. Blackbacks are now protected by the Chandrilan government and given vast conservation habitats, including the Hanna Wild Game Preserve. Hunting permits for blackbacks are upwards of 200,000 credits per kill, which is then put back into blackback breeding programs.",

In this regard they are quite useful, and they are generally tolerated as long as they do not make a nuisance of themselves. They can be found in sewer systems and garbage repositories on thousands of worlds, and even aboard larger space stations.

Brightly colored avians with reptilian features, jubba birds are prized for their red, yellow, and purple plumage as much as for their beautiful, haunting song. The jubba bird’s whis­ tling call is actually an instinctual ability to tap into the Living Force, and it produces a peaceful sensation in those who hear it. Jubba birds have small bodies but large wings, and they fare poorly in cages. Luckily, if an owner feeds his bird regularly, it is more than content to remain on a roost or perch and refrain from terror­ izing a household or attempting to hunt other pets. On Dagobah, jubba birds hunt small prey such as rodents or other birds, but in captivity, a well-fed jubba bird will fight only to defend itself. Most importantly, if the jubba bird is not content, it refuses to sing.\n\nFew owners realize that jubba birds are deceptively intelligent. While not as smart as most sapient spe­cies, they possess a level of cunning and a capacity for comprehension that dwarfs most animal species. Some researchers suspect that jubba birds deliberate­ ly pretend to be less intelligent when interacting with other species. These suspicions are only reinforced by rumors that, when paired with owners they trust and care for, jubba birds can act with more deliberation and foresight.",

They have short, brindled coats with white bellies; long, thick tails; and narrow, black legs that end in long, sharp claws. Their faces are remarkably expressive, with solid black eyes, large ears, and a broad mouth full of needle-sharp teeth.\n\nLoth-cats live solitary lives primarily in Lothal’s vast grasslands, coming together only to breed and raise kits. Hunting by sight and hearing, they prey largely on loth-rats and other assorted rodents and avifauna. Expert stalkers, loth-cats hunt their prey for hours or even days, waiting for the perfect time to attack. Once committed, a loth-cat springs from hiding and attempts to kill its prey as quickly as possible. When attacking prey larger than themselves, usually when frightened or cornered, a loth-cat typically goes for a target’s face first, clawing at eyes and any other sensitive areas. Loth-cats only fight larger prey until they can escape or the creature is driven off, and will run if they can.\n\nWhile most are wild, loth-cats can be domesticated, with varying degrees of success. They make fine, if capricious and slightly destructive, pets. With enough patience, they can even be trained to hunt and retrieve.",

These non-sentient hunters evolved in the crucible of Vendaxa’s harsh eco­system to become finely honed killing machines. An acklay’s high metabolism gives it a great deal of energy, especially when hunting. Acklays are thick-shelled crus­taceans that can live underwater or on land. The ack­lay’s three eyes can see in almost-total darkness, and each of its legs ends in an enormous claw it uses to pin or slash at prey. Because of their combat prowess, ack­lays are used across the galaxy in gladiatorial arenas.",

During the day, the birds ride thermal updrafts above fields of silvergrass to feed on various rodents and large insects that would otherwise destroy crops. Many are trained by gamwidge ranchers to ward off llayas that threaten their herd.\n\nThe Doellinists revere the bird as avatars of Doellin herself, keeping her fields free of pests. The Tayan League takes much of its philosophy from the falcon. The concepts of exile and pacifism are linked to the falcon’s unique trick of driving off llayas with shriek­ ing and dive-bombing feints. Falcon imagery is often incorporated into religious symbols and trappings of both priesthood and government office.",
