They seem to be an evolutionary dead-end; they are primitive, flightless birds with reptilian features, a sharp black beak, beady eyers, and long powerful, legs that can kick holes in a ferrocrete wall. They are spiteful, cross-grained, and aggressive beasts that are hard to tame and dangerous to work with, even after they’ve been domesticated. As their name suggests, carrion spats feed on dead and decayed animals, which makes them unpleasant to be around due to the lingering stench of death that surrounds them. However, this diet makes them nearly immune to poisons and toxins, and some have even been reported to eat hazardous chemicals and industrial waste with no negative effects.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, they enjoy a fair amount of popularity as riding animals thanks to their size and endurance. Once tamed and used to both saddle and rider, carrions spats make excellent mounts, especially in rough or mountainous country where their innate sense of balance and wide-splayed feet allow them to move through broken terrain with ease. Eventually, after long periods of work with a rider, a carrion spat becomes bonded; after that, it will protect its rider at all costs, even to its death. In combat, unless otherwise directed, these creatures charge headlong into their enemies at incredible speeds, lashing out with their deadly feet and snapping at anything within range of their beaks. Once engaged, they are hard to extract and if they can’t be brought under control , they will fight until exhausted or killed.",

They stand a little over a metre high and have a wingspan of roughly two and a half metres. Their plumage is primarily copper or brass coloured with crimson, orange, and white highlights. Occasionally, a flame ibbot develops primarily iridescent, blue-black plumage with coppery or crimson highlights, and these rare creatures are highly sought as pets. The flame ibbot’s diet consists of both small fish and insects native to the Boiling Sea, as well as the kettleweed that grows there. In fact, it is more from their habit of eating kettleweed, and not their colouration, that gives the flame ibbot its name. When threatened, flame ibbots spit a powerful jet of caustic bile and steaming hot water that builds up in their stomachs as they digest kettleweed. This viscous liquid causes extreme discomfort, disorientation and temporary blindness.",

These gigantic birds stand three to four metres tall on average and have a wingspan of over ten metres. Their plumage is similar to the flame ibbot, primarily copper- or brass-coloured with black and brown highlights, with white or cream-coloured feathers on their abdomen and the undersides of their wings. Great ibbots have wicked, serrated orange beaks that can slice through nearly any material as if it were rotten cloth, and powerful talons that can tear a gundark limb from limb. They feed primarily on fish and other aquatic life-forms, and are particular to spikefish, snatching the massive creatures from lakes and seas when they surface for air. Although they prefer fish, wild specimens have a tendency to prey on herd animals (and even domesticated pets, on occasion).\n\nDue to their size and relative intelligence, great ibbots are easily domesticated. They take training quite well and can follow complicated multi-step instructions. The Wingriders, Drall’s state police force cum courier service, are mounted on these great beings and are the most visible keeper of great ibbots. There are also a number of tour companies who offer adventure tours of Drall’s countryside mounted on great ibbots, although these are rare due to the danger of mounting untrained individuals on willful, intelligent giant raptors.",

Brightly colored avians with reptilian features, jubba birds are prized for their red, yellow, and purple plumage as much as for their beautiful, haunting song. The jubba bird’s whis­ tling call is actually an instinctual ability to tap into the Living Force, and it produces a peaceful sensation in those who hear it. Jubba birds have small bodies but large wings, and they fare poorly in cages. Luckily, if an owner feeds his bird regularly, it is more than content to remain on a roost or perch and refrain from terror­ izing a household or attempting to hunt other pets. On Dagobah, jubba birds hunt small prey such as rodents or other birds, but in captivity, a well-fed jubba bird will fight only to defend itself. Most importantly, if the jubba bird is not content, it refuses to sing.\n\nFew owners realize that jubba birds are deceptively intelligent. While not as smart as most sapient spe­cies, they possess a level of cunning and a capacity for comprehension that dwarfs most animal species. Some researchers suspect that jubba birds deliberate­ ly pretend to be less intelligent when interacting with other species. These suspicions are only reinforced by rumors that, when paired with owners they trust and care for, jubba birds can act with more deliberation and foresight.",

		"description": "Members of the far-flung tooka family, loth-cats are small, wild felines native to Lothal. They are, on average, about a metre long and can weigh as much as fifteen kilograms. They have short, brindled coats with white bellies; long, thick tails; and narrow, black legs that end in long, sharp claws. Their faces are remarkably expressive, with solid black eyes, large ears, and a broad mouth full of needle-sharp teeth.\n\nLoth-cats live solitary lives primarily in Lothal’s vast grasslands, coming together only to breed and raise kits. Hunting by sight and hearing, they prey largely on loth-rats and other assorted rodents and avifauna. Expert stalkers, loth-cats hunt their prey for hours or even days, waiting for the perfect time to attack. Once committed, a loth-cat springs from hiding and attempts to kill its prey as quickly as possible. When attacking prey larger than themselves, usually when frightened or cornered, a loth-cat typically goes for a target’s face first, clawing at eyes and any other sensitive areas. Loth-cats only fight larger prey until they can escape or the creature is driven off, and will run if they can.\n\nWhile most are wild, loth-cats can be domesticated, with varying degrees of success. They make fine, if capricious and slightly destructive, pets. With enough patience, they can even be trained to hunt and retrieve.",

In addition to its toothy maw, a squir fish has four long, razor-tipped appendages on the underside of its body with which it can lash out to seize its prey. All of these factors make it one of the most feared predators in the seas of Sakiya.\n\n Skuir fish average five meters in length, but they have been known to grow much larger in colder, deeper waters. Adult skuir fish are hunted for their meat by harpoon ships on Saki, but the vicious crea­tures claim many crewmembers of the seafaring ves­sels as well. Folklore even tells of a stark-white skuir fish called Oloss Yvae, which is so gigantic that it sinks entire harpoon vessels and swallows their crew whole. Many of lepatap Harbor’s albino exiles see this mythical leviathan as a symbol, a hero that exacts the revenge they desire upon their persecutors.",

This may be one reason why thrantas evolved to be creatures purely of the air, no longer needing legs on which to land. Over time, Alderaanians domesticated numerous breeds of this beast to be used as mounts. Today, only the common and baleen thrantas survive in any measurable quantity.

Varactyls make excellent fast-moving mounts, and have been known to rival the speeds of airspeeders in short sprints, with powerful claws that allow them to climb over many obstacles that would hinder most other mounts.",

They use a mild poison in their whiplike tails to stun prey, then kill it with their teeth or claws. Vornskrs are Force-sensitive, a result of hunting prey with Force-sensitivity on their homeworld. A vornskr immediately focuses on any Force-sensitive creatures or individuals in its pres­ence as soon as it senses them, and generally attacks without hesitation. Mercenary Jedi hunters and Impe­rial Inquisitors have been known to use vornskrs to help ferret out Force-sensitive fugitives.",

As a result, ysalamiri developed an unusual defense: a natural “bubble” around them that negates other creatures’ ability to influence the Force. These docile, tree-dwelling creatures resemble half-meter-long furred lizards and live deep within the forests of Myrkr, where they have claimed the canopy as their own. They are herbivores, feasting on the sap of the trees in which they live, and they use only their teeth to defend themselves if attacked. As a result of their Force-negating abilities, ysalamiri are highly valued as pets and companions by anyone who fears those who use the Force.",
