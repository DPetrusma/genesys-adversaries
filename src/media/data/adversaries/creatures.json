The creatures are scavengers, living off organic material (primarily waste products) and metabolizing it while leaving behind any mineral content that it might contain. In this regard they are quite useful, and they are generally tolerated as long as they do not make a nuisance of themselves. They can be found in sewer systems and garbage repositories on thousands of worlds, and even aboard larger space stations. Their widespread presence is due to the fact that the larvae of a dianoga is virtually microscopic in size, and thus can make its egress from one location to another very simply.",

The Lost maintain a great deal of devious cunning even as their rational minds have faded away.",

Their shaggy white hair allows these vicious creatures to perfectly blend with Hoth’s snowy landscape so they can sneak up on their prey undetected. Wampas typically dwell in ice caverns formed by underground hot springs nestled within the tundra, venturing out into the open only when hunting for food. Wampas subsist primarily on tauntauns, and they display a surprising degree of intelligence when stalking their prey. Unlike most carnivores, wampas prefer to cap­ture their prey alive and dangle their future meal from the ceiling of their lair until they are ready to dine on fresh meat.",
