Æffects:
• Cleansing: As a maneuver or as part of an action us-
ing this Æffect may deplete this Æffect to remove all
poisons, toxins, and similar afflictions from them-
self or their target; if used as a maneuver, this power
targets one character within short range.
• Find: May use the effect to locate a particular crea-
ture or object at a very great distance, potentially
any where on the Crucible. The target must be a
being, object, or creature that the Witch personal-
ly encountered before. This power gives them an
unerring sense of the direction and distance to the
target while they are using the power, but not of any
intervening obstacles, their surroundings, or other
details. If the target does not want to be found (or
if someone intentionally hid the object), this should
require an opposed Æmbercraft check versus the
target's Discipline or Stealth. The process of suing
the power generally take too long to occur during
structure gameplay.
• Flare: As a maneuver, may use this Æffect o release
a blinding flash of psychic light, disorienting all en-
emy characters within medium range for one round
and inflicting one strain on each of them.
Equipment:
