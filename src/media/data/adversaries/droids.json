At the lower end of the spectrum, early astromech droids were little more than automated navicomputers with some maintenance capabilities. The more sophisticated among them, specifically the universally successful R-series droids from Industrial Automaton, are among the most intelligent and advanced of all Class Two droids. The R2 model of droids in particular are notorious for developing quirky personalities in the absence of regular memory wipes. Part, of the reason that Alliance starhghters are so much more advanced than their Imperial counterparts without a significant increase in size is the utilization of astromech droids, which facilitate many of the more difficult computer functions necessary for the fighters to operate. In Imperial forces, astromech droid use is limited largely to capital-scale vessels that require redundant backups to ensure smooth functioning, regardless of circumstance.",
