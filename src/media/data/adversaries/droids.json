		"name": "Sorosuub G2 Repair Droid",

		"description": "The G2 repair droid is a custom Sullustan design produced by SoroSuub. Intended to assist with shipboard repair, many of these droids instead found themselves utilized as pilots and tour guides for civil­ ian charter vessels. Referred to as “goose droids” due to their widely spaced feet, long necks, and clumsy gait, G2s tend to possess a quirky demeanor and exhibit exces­sively chatty behavior. Over time, the droids also develop a unique sense of humor, trading witticisms and bad jokes with anyone who takes the time to listen.\n\nOverall, the G2 series droids were appreciated by their owners and the tourists they were charged with. Many G2 owners would relieve their droids of their jobs and keep them around as companions. The series’s down­ fall, however, lay in the fact that larger corporations considered them a waste of money due to their tendency to talk rather than work.",

		"name": "Sorosuub Wanderer Scout Survey Droid",
		"type": "Rival",
		"description": "Often used to collect indigenous wildlife for further study and research, the SoroSuub wanderer scout survey droid is part of a larger set of droids deployed planetside as scouts and collectors. The wanderer scout’s powerful stun blasters, swivel-mounted pho­toreceptor, and dedicated medical and scouting programming make it an excellent tool for informa­tion gathering. Many have been turned to the more serious business of espionage against sentient tar­gets and critical locations. Most of the scout survey’s two-meter height is made up of eight spiderlike legs arranged around a relatively small spherical body. While the wanderer is quick and agile, the medical and scouting modules take up most of the available interior space, leaving little room for a personality matrix. As such, these droids lack any personality fea­tures, but they are well regarded for the depth, detail, and unprejudiced nature of the information they col­lect as a result.",

Probe droids travel to their destinations inside one-way hyperspace pods and communicate with their programmers via encrypted holo-channels. When the quarry may be on any of a thousand worlds, the best solution is often to disperse a thousand probe droids.",
