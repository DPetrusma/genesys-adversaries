Tall and angular, the 501-Z is clad in heavy-duty, shock-resistant armour that gives these droids a rather imposing appear­ance. Colloquially known as Zeds, these droids fea­ture a sophisticated analytical droid brain that is part protocol droid and part combat droid. They are pro­grammed for communications, community relations, riot control, and general policing, and they have a reputation as dogged and competent law enforce­ment officers. Some have even been upgraded to operate as detectives and special investigators, using their analytic brains and programming to great effect. While they are typically programmed to use only non-lethal force, those used by SoroSuub for corporate security operations can, and often do, use lethal force when protecting highly sensitive corporate assets.",

The more sophisticated among them, specifically the universally successful R-series droids from Industrial Automaton, are among the most intelligent and advanced of all Class Two droids. The R2 model of droids in particular are notorious for developing quirky personalities in the absence of regular memory wipes. Part, of the reason that Alliance starhghters are so much more advanced than their Imperial counterparts without a significant increase in size is the utilization of astromech droids, which facilitate many of the more difficult computer functions necessary for the fighters to operate. In Imperial forces, astromech droid use is limited largely to capital-scale vessels that require redundant backups to ensure smooth functioning, regardless of circumstance.",

Despite their carefree and can-do attitudes, Q-4s aren’t particularly bright, and they often bite off more than they can chew if left unattended for long periods of time.

Designed as a protocol droid, the series’ moniker, “worker drone,” was decep­tive to potential customers, who assumed it was just another labor droid. In addition, the unit’s appear­ance, which was distinctly bug-like, in conjunction with its flat personality, turned many mammalian species off. The Verpine even attempted to market the droid to other insectoid species, still without much success.\n\nMost of the J9 worker drones purchased by the public were placed in labor jobs, wasting their more advanced systems and programming on menial tasks. Because of this, J9s are some of the most intelligent labor droids on the market. Over time, however, they develop somewhat bitter personalities, as they feel they were destined for something greater but were somehow cheated out of it.\n\nThe Rebel Alliance has acquired a large number of surplus J9 worker drones directly from Roche and has put them to good use. The Alliance realizes that the J9 is much more than a simple labor droid, and many of the units have been assigned to Rebel teams to assist them with translation and analysis. So far, the majority of these J9s have been a success in the field.",
