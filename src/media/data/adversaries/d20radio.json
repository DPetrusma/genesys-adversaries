		"description": "Storm Commandos are the Empire’s elite fighting force, formed in direct response to the Rebellion’s guerrilla warfare tactics. Also known as shadow scouts, these troops are selected and trained to conduct special operations under demanding circumstances where regular troops prove incapable. In turn, those officers who lead storm commandos into battle are nothing less than exemplary. Only the most dedicated, skilled, and knowledgeable officers are selected to lead after undergoing grueling physical and mental tests originally instituted by the now-defector Crix Madine. Generally, Storm Commando Officers are deployed on the battlefield in one of two roles. First, and most common, is for these officers to directly lead Storm Commando groupings of 5-50 commandos on special operations. Planning and executing operations is the commando officer’s bread and butter. More rarely though, Storm Commando Officers can be deployed to mentor, and indeed lead for, other Imperial or affiliated force commanders. While not often discussed, a small team of Storm Commandos led by an experienced officer can turn even the greenest planetary defense militia into a dangerous weapon of war. These officers are supported and protected by a hand-picked team of 2-5 commandos. At the GM’s discretion, this command team can also train supported forces providing them a Boost die in Mass Combat.",

		"type": "Nemesis",
		"description": "“Look, I’ve known old Gruuzhnag for the better part of 30 years. Sure, he might look like the rest of those pigs, but that’s where you’d be wrong. You’ll never meet a better doctor or mechanic this far outside of civilization. Yeah, the parts for his cybernetics are cobbled together, but what can you expect so far out in the Rim? And I can assure you he has no love for the Empire. And the last goomba who stuck his nose into the pig’s chop shop walked away minus an arm. As long as you’ve got the credits, he’ll help you out. Just don’t ask about his scars. Trust me on that one.” \n\nBackground: Gruuzhnag was a brilliant Gamorrean even by the standards of species noted for their intelligence. He was taken with ideas that were so far above the primitive qualities of his kin that he quickly found himself ostracized from a very early age. He eventually stole away on a passing freighter that had stopped down for a few days to avoid an Imperial patrol. He quickly made an impression on the ship’s captain when he found the young Gruuzhnag disassembling and reassembling some auxiliary components. He was almost immediately put to work under the tutelage of the ship’s doctor, who was also serving as chief engineer. It wasn’t long before Gruuzhnag began to pick up on the doctor’s medical knowledge and started to put together some rudimentary methods to marry his mechanical and medical knowledge.\n\nHe was planning on using the money he earned aboard the ship to enter into an academy in the Core Worlds, but never got the chance. Taken captive in a pirate raid, Gruuzhnag was sold into slavery – specifically into the gladiatorial circuit. Forced to fight or die, Gruuzhnag chose to fight, learning how to survive in the arena, leveraging the natural inclinations of his species to give himself a needed edge.\n\nOver the months he was there, he also started to win several of the other gladiators to his side. This proved useful when he decided it was time to break out. He staged a daring attempt, leading his few fellow gladiators in overpowering the guards and escaping into the countryside. Unfortunately, they were pursued by a larger force and caught several kilometers outside of the arena’s walls. They fought valiantly but in the resulting battle, Gruuzhnag’s force was utterly decimated and the Gamorrean himself left for dead, having lost both of his arms. Somehow, he managed to avoid death and dragged himself several more kilometers to the nearest settlement. He found an abandoned garage with several still functioning droids. He used them to help construct himself some rudimentary prosthetics and then managed to smuggle himself off world.\n\nGruuzhnag has since set himself up deep in the Outer Rim where he has made a small amount of notoriety for himself as a brilliant, if somewhat odd, cybernetic surgeon. His parts tend to be scavenged and secondhand, but no one can argue how durable and functional they are. He doesn’t like to talk about his past, but he keeps the vibroax that took his arms on the wall in his shop, and he’s not shy about using it if he needs to. Over the years he has patched himself some serviceable cybernetic replacements for the very basic prosthetics he originally constructed. He tends to conduct his actual business through his droids nowadays, very rarely speaking to the customers himself. But if you have need for his services, Gruuzhnag’s Chop Shop can probably help you.\n\nSuggested Use: Gruuzhnag can be a great contact for the player characters, especially if they desperately need medical attention and are stuck far out in the Rim away from civilization. If they don’t have proper payment, Gruuzhnag’s stances against slavery and piracy can be leveraged as Obligation for the characters as he agrees to help them in return for helping him stamp out a particularly nasty group of slavers that is operating on the planet. Alternatively, if the PCs are the kind of group that find themselves routinely engaged in piracy and slavery, Gruuzhnag can be a very dangerous opponent on any Outer Rim world they attempt to acquire more merchandise on.",

However, even where the Jedi cleansed entire worlds the terentatek would return generations later. Jedi scholars believe the terentatek enter hibernation and hiding when the dark side wanes in the galaxy, only to awaken and emerge in times of conflict and suffering. Despite their horrifying reputation, bold treasure hunters often seek out reports of terentatek sightings in hope that the beasts are evidence of undiscovered tombs and therefore unclaimed riches.

These blind avian predators prefer to live and hunt in dark, enclosed spaces where their echolocation grants them the advantage. Although they will defend their nests with reckless frenzy, shyracks will not normally attack any but the smallest prey. This reclusive nature is mysteriously abandoned every 63rd summer on Moraband, when shyracks spill out of their caves to fill the sky. Old Republic biologists speculated this phenomenon was the result of tectonic resonance creating powerful ultrasonic noise, and that ultrasonic emitters could frenzy or even control shyrack swarms. With the rise of the Empire, such research has been removed from all but the most remote of libraries.",

		"description": "Kath Scarlet is the captain of the Binayre Pirates, a small band of pirates operating in the Corellian Sector after the rise of the Empire. She earned her position of power by elevating the Binayre from a small-time swoop gang in the slums of Corellia to a full-fledged pirate organization. Her group has since grown significantly in size, but are still poorly regarded – even among the galactic underworld. This is due primarily to Kath’s reputation as an utterly ruthless pirate, double-crossing her employers and allies without a second thought when the credits are right. Her brazen and backstabbing approach to business is the responsible for the Binayre’s rapid rise to power but may also lead to its early demise.\n\nPersonality: Kath projects what she thinks of as a rakish air – reckless, vicious, and impertinent. However, beneath her audacious front lies a cunning and treacherous mind. Scarlet grew up in the worst areas of Coronet City on Corellia and feels entirely justified in taking nearly any action, no matter how nefarious, to ensure she keeps what little status she has amassed. She is capable of clever planning and isn’t afraid to bite off more than she can chew if she believes the reward outweighs the risks.\n\nTactics: Under Scarlet’s leadership, the Binayre mainly focus on hitting lightly guarded or unarmed ships throughout the Corellian Sector. Her starships and supplies are precious, and she won’t risk them unless the potential rewards are worth it. Intent on squeezing every last bit of profit from each prize, Scarlet often steals and fences both the ship and its cargo and has even been known to sell the target’s crew into slavery. This brutal and mercenary approach has given her a bad reputation, even among other pirate crews.",
