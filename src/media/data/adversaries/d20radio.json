The elite Novatroopers of the Imperial Stormtrooper corps follow this historical convention. Their distinctive reinforced black and gold armor is symbolic of the Novatroopers’ dual role. While rarely seen except at military parades and Imperial ceremonies, these honor guards are just as capable of conducting intense combat as they are looking sharp for the Imperial HoloNet news. The Novatroopers focus on instilling intense discipline within their ranks, even more so than regular Stormtroopers. Rumors circulate in Imperial military circles of extreme feats of discipline demanded in their training, such as executing traditional parade maneuver while subjected to tear gas. No matter their training methods, would-be assassins would do well to remember these guardsmen are more than just ceremonial – they will fight expertly and to the death to protect their charge.",

Range troopers secure and patrol vast territories on uncivilized, icy worlds selected for imperial development. Although not special operations forces, range troopers screen candidates for mental toughness and physical resilience above the norm. These traits breed a strong collective identity and feeling of eliteness above regular stormtroopers.\n\nEquipped similarly to the cold assault stormtrooper, known to most as snowtroopers, range trooper armor integrates arctic survival gear and provides freedom of movement for long patrol routes. Unlike the offensively oriented snowtroopers, range troopers are equipped to conduct security patrols and sentry duties. Range troopers utilize a variety of overboot systems to enhance mobility, from simple skis and snowshoes to climbing cleats and magnetic boots. This ensures Imperial assets can be protected, whether over vast swaths of snow or on high-speed conveyex transports.\n\nRange troopers operate in small units on detached service, often with little contact or oversight by higher command. This isolation from the rest of the imperial military, and indeed galactic civilization, fosters a frontier spirit of cold determination. Range troopers strive to accomplish any mission assigned, but they do so their own way and prefer not to cooperate with other units they deem less capable.",

Only the most dedicated, skilled, and knowledgeable officers are selected to lead after undergoing grueling physical and mental tests originally instituted by the now-defector Crix Madine. Generally, Storm Commando Officers are deployed on the battlefield in one of two roles. First, and most common, is for these officers to directly lead Storm Commando groupings of 5-50 commandos on special operations. Planning and executing operations is the commando officer’s bread and butter. More rarely though, Storm Commando Officers can be deployed to mentor, and indeed lead for, other Imperial or affiliated force commanders. While not often discussed, a small team of Storm Commandos led by an experienced officer can turn even the greenest planetary defense militia into a dangerous weapon of war. These officers are supported and protected by a hand-picked team of 2-5 commandos. At the GM’s discretion, this command team can also train supported forces providing them a Boost die in Mass Combat.",

		"description": "“Look, I’ve known old Gruuzhnag for the better part of 30 years. Sure, he might look like the rest of those pigs, but that’s where you’d be wrong. You’ll never meet a better doctor or mechanic this far outside of civilization. Yeah, the parts for his cybernetics are cobbled together, but what can you expect so far out in the Rim? And I can assure you he has no love for the Empire. And the last goomba who stuck his nose into the pig’s chop shop walked away minus an arm. As long as you’ve got the credits, he’ll help you out. Just don’t ask about his scars. Trust me on that one.” \n\nBackground: Gruuzhnag was a brilliant Gamorrean even by the standards of species noted for their intelligence. He was taken with ideas that were so far above the primitive qualities of his kin that he quickly found himself ostracized from a very early age. He eventually stole away on a passing freighter that had stopped down for a few days to avoid an Imperial patrol. He quickly made an impression on the ship’s captain when he found the young Gruuzhnag disassembling and reassembling some auxiliary components. He was almost immediately put to work under the tutelage of the ship’s doctor, who was also serving as chief engineer. It wasn’t long before Gruuzhnag began to pick up on the doctor’s medical knowledge and started to put together some rudimentary methods to marry his mechanical and medical knowledge.\n\nHe was planning on using the money he earned aboard the ship to enter into an academy in the Core Worlds, but never got the chance. Taken captive in a pirate raid, Gruuzhnag was sold into slavery – specifically into the gladiatorial circuit. Forced to fight or die, Gruuzhnag chose to fight, learning how to survive in the arena, leveraging the natural inclinations of his species to give himself a needed edge.\n\nOver the months he was there, he also started to win several of the other gladiators to his side. This proved useful when he decided it was time to break out. He staged a daring attempt, leading his few fellow gladiators in overpowering the guards and escaping into the countryside. Unfortunately, they were pursued by a larger force and caught several kilometers outside of the arena’s walls. They fought valiantly but in the resulting battle, Gruuzhnag’s force was utterly decimated and the Gamorrean himself left for dead, having lost both of his arms. Somehow, he managed to avoid death and dragged himself several more kilometers to the nearest settlement. He found an abandoned garage with several still functioning droids. He used them to help construct himself some rudimentary prosthetics and then managed to smuggle himself off world.\n\nGruuzhnag has since set himself up deep in the Outer Rim where he has made a small amount of notoriety for himself as a brilliant, if somewhat odd, cybernetic surgeon. His parts tend to be scavenged and secondhand, but no one can argue how durable and functional they are. He doesn’t like to talk about his past, but he keeps the vibroax that took his arms on the wall in his shop, and he’s not shy about using it if he needs to. Over the years he has patched himself some serviceable cybernetic replacements for the very basic prosthetics he originally constructed. He tends to conduct his actual business through his droids nowadays, very rarely speaking to the customers himself. But if you have need for his services, Gruuzhnag’s Chop Shop can probably help you.\n\nSuggested Use: Gruuzhnag can be a great contact for the player characters, especially if they desperately need medical attention and are stuck far out in the Rim away from civilization. If they don’t have proper payment, Gruuzhnag’s stances against slavery and piracy can be leveraged as Obligation for the characters as he agrees to help them in return for helping him stamp out a particularly nasty group of slavers that is operating on the planet. Alternatively, if the PCs are the kind of group that find themselves routinely engaged in piracy and slavery, Gruuzhnag can be a very dangerous opponent on any Outer Rim world they attempt to acquire more merchandise on.",

Over the millennia, the Jedi have launched the Great Hunts. These hunts were concerted efforts to wipe out the scourge of these beasts by dispatching teams of trained Jedi across the galaxy. However, even where the Jedi cleansed entire worlds the terentatek would return generations later. Jedi scholars believe the terentatek enter hibernation and hiding when the dark side wanes in the galaxy, only to awaken and emerge in times of conflict and suffering. Despite their horrifying reputation, bold treasure hunters often seek out reports of terentatek sightings in hope that the beasts are evidence of undiscovered tombs and therefore unclaimed riches.

She earned her position of power by elevating the Binayre from a small-time swoop gang in the slums of Corellia to a full-fledged pirate organization. Her group has since grown significantly in size, but are still poorly regarded – even among the galactic underworld. This is due primarily to Kath’s reputation as an utterly ruthless pirate, double-crossing her employers and allies without a second thought when the credits are right. Her brazen and backstabbing approach to business is the responsible for the Binayre’s rapid rise to power but may also lead to its early demise.\n\nPersonality: Kath projects what she thinks of as a rakish air – reckless, vicious, and impertinent. However, beneath her audacious front lies a cunning and treacherous mind. Scarlet grew up in the worst areas of Coronet City on Corellia and feels entirely justified in taking nearly any action, no matter how nefarious, to ensure she keeps what little status she has amassed. She is capable of clever planning and isn’t afraid to bite off more than she can chew if she believes the reward outweighs the risks.\n\nTactics: Under Scarlet’s leadership, the Binayre mainly focus on hitting lightly guarded or unarmed ships throughout the Corellian Sector. Her starships and supplies are precious, and she won’t risk them unless the potential rewards are worth it. Intent on squeezing every last bit of profit from each prize, Scarlet often steals and fences both the ship and its cargo and has even been known to sell the target’s crew into slavery. This brutal and mercenary approach has given her a bad reputation, even among other pirate crews.",

		"description": "Background: Born to an enslaved family of Tibanna gas miners on the Hutt controlled world of Sleheyron, Chell spent most of her youth dreaming of escaping the miserable living and working conditions of her family. Before long, she lost both parents (her mother died in an accident, and her father was sold without notice) and was forced to make her own way. Unfortunately, there are few opportunities for a slave child, least of all in Hutt controlled space.\n\nChell began to inform on other slaves to earn her meals and eventually turned to tracking escapees full-time once she bought her freedom. Now a fully licensed bounty hunter, Chell primarily patrols Hutt space (though she will still take Imperial contracts on criminals seeking refuge in the Hutt’s domain). She hasn’t brought in any high-profile targets yet, but her track record for recovering escaped slaves with icy detachment has earned her the nickname “Cold Case” – a moniker and reputation she has embraced by christening her first starship with it.\n\nChell has a well-earned reputation for pitiless, professional detachment. The conditions of her childhood taught her that she couldn’t trust anyone and she would need to be ruthless to survive into adulthood. As a result, she rarely partners with other hunters and has trained a pack of Corellian hounds to assist her on hunts. She takes excellent care of her hounds and shows them more affection than she has ever shown another sentient being",

A Core Worlder from a reasonably well connected family, Zavalle was a rising star within the Imperial Navy until she ran afoul of Admiral Motti while assigned to his staff. It was not long before Admiral Motti grew tired of Zavalle’s constant questioning of his assumptions and beliefs. Given Zavalle’s exemplary record, Motti’s only recourse to dispose of her was arranging a promotion to a remote posting – commander of long range patrols in the Outer Rim. Undefeated, Zavalle re-organized forces within her jurisdiction into a unique formation of fast, light, and numerous strike craft. Her fleet may not be doctrinal, but it has been wildly successful in hunting down criminals and Rebels alike.\n\nRagtag by Imperial standards, Admiral Zavalle’s strike group more closely resembles the Rebel Alliance fleet than the usual image of the Imperial Navy. Instead of being centered around a few Star Destroyers, her forces include Raider-class corvettes, Quasar Fire-class light carriers, innumerable TIEs of most variants, and a handful of Arquitens-class light cruisers.These forces are by no means heavy, but Zavalle emphasizes the strengths of her formation: flexibility, speed, and the de-centralization of capabilities. Losing any one ship will have little effect on the strike group’s combat effectiveness, unlike the hammer blow that the loss of a Star Destroyer can be in a mid-sized fleet engagement. This makes her forces a unique threat and potentially a refreshing challenge for your PCs.",

Karvek grew up on the frontier of the Outer Rim. His rustic upbringing, like that of many of his enemies in the Rebellion, fostered a strong sense of independence. Karvek fully embraces the Storm Commando’s purpose: to fight fire with fire by employing asymmetric tactics against the Rebel Alliance. But Major Karvek takes this doctrine a step further than simply replicating guerrilla tactics. He sees the value that the Rebel’s use of individual initiative brings to the battlefield, and thus demands that of his 909th Detachment commandos.\n\n909th Storm Commando Detachment\n\nNormally dispatched on deliberate operations or attached to other forces in a platoon, or even squad sized elements, it is rare to see an entire Storm Commando detachment conduct missions under their organic chain of command. Major Karvek’s detachment, the 909th, is an exception to this rule. When mission success is demanded under extreme circumstances, but when the deployment of mass numbers of conventional forces proves undesirable, the 909th is dispatched to do with a company what would be expected of a regiment. Karvek’s commandos are highly trained and capable of operating on their own initiative, making this detachment ready for anything.",

A trained engineer, experienced armored officer, and decorated commander, it should be no surprise a man who has spent more than half his life working with war machines sees the military in this way. The Imperial Army is a complicated with a vast array of specialties, unit types, equipment loadouts, and tactical procedures. Infighting between the branches and the use of pet projects to advance careers further divides the Army. Little enrages Vilneon more than this, for he sees it as akin to debating whether the repulsorlift or the powerplant is more important on a hovertank – both are vital and must work in concert. General Vilneon has thus made a career of organizing combined arms groups from different branches and service, building true teams with strong cohesion and identity. While fully implementing Imperial doctrine and uniformity, Vilneon has added something the Imperial military lacks despite its stated ideology: unity.\n\n7th Assault Battlegroup\n\nBattlegroups are normally commanded by High Colonels, with Major Generals commanding a Corps comprised of several Battlegroups. Given General Vilneon’s high status, it should be no surprise the 7th Assault Battlegroup has a unique task organization. A normal Assault Battlegroup would be composed of two line regiments, an assault regiment, and an armored regiment. The 7th instead has two assault regiments augmented with walkers, an armored regiment, and a stormtrooper regiment. These troops train extensively in combined arms operations. Retaining the regimental system for little more than administrative purposes, this battlegroup is functionally organized around a series of combined arms brigades that train and fight together. The result is a highly coordinated, and therefore deadly, opponent to face on the battlefield.",

Their great speed has made them sought after by gambling houses all across the galaxy and caused the enslavement of many of their kind. They are hunted and forced to race in many casinos and race tracks in the galaxy. In fact, when kept in captivity, Fathiers often must endure “Double-Gravity” chambers causing them to gain strength even when moving about their confined areas. The people of Canto Bight on the planet Cantonica are particularly cruel to the animals.\n\nFathiers are easily domesticated and can be fitted with a riding harness and saddle. Tognath Mercenaries during the time of the Galactic Civil War often rode Fathiers during hit and run missions.",

		"description": "The complexity of the galaxy’s conflicts mean all but the lowest level military commanders need dedicated staff officers to help plan and manage operations. Whether analyzing information, coordinating forces, planning for contingencies, or ensuring support, these officers focus on the details for their commander. This frees the commander to think big picture, able to do the art rather than the science of military operations. Thus it is said, behind every Ackbar or Thrawn are unknown, but effective staff turning their commander’s vision into reality.\n\nThe goliath Imperial war machine employs thousands of staff officers in an effort to keep the gears of war turning. Service on a staff is often seen as necessary for career progression through forging networks across branches and securing patronage from higher officers. This career climbing can come at a price for Imperial efficiency, however, as some unscrupulous officers find sabotage of others easier than succeeding on their own merits.\n\nThe Rebel Alliance, strapped for personnel at all levels, can rarely afford to spare enough officers for a full staff. Qualified officers are needed in command positions, and indeed academy trained leaders are a minority in the ranks. Instead of a rigid doctrinal definition of staff, the Alliance uses collaborative planning to perform the same basic function. Specialists from all walks of life, and all ranks, are invited to contribute when their expertise may be useful. With a galaxy-wide war of liberation to fight, most Rebel commanders will heed the words of  the former professor even if they wear a lowly enlisted rank in the Alliance’s military hierarchy.",

Resistance snipers leverage their home turf advantage, effectively using navigation and camouflage to turn the mud into protection from Imperial observation and fire. These superior skills allow snipers to take optimum positions, laying in wait for the best targets to emerge.\n\nThe legendary Clone Commandos of the last war trained many of these snipers, instructing them to fire at Separatist organic commanders or tactical droids instead of the rank and file. The Mimbanese have adapted this tactic, preferring to eliminate officers and senior NCOs where possible. Given the Imperial Army infantry is made up of washouts from stormtrooper training, troublemakers booted from the Imperial Academies, and single-term enlistees trying to earn a credit, this decapitation tactic has proven exceptionally effective for the Mimbanese.",

Less effective than the First Order’s stormtroopers in a straight up fight, a fringe benefit from this ad-hoc approach means each Resistance squad is likely to contain experts in other fields.

A meter wide, roughly spherical body houses the droid’s primary systems. A series of multi spectrum photoreceptors adorns the outer shell, providing optimal surveillance capabilities. Beneath the main body hang four segmented arms, each equipped with a different sensor or manipulator. Imperial engineers designed the droids specifically to be unsettling to organics, an effect magnified by their tendency to float just above eye level.\n\nThese droids are omnipresent on the Sith Empire’s core worlds. Installations such as star ports, public transport, and government buildings are constantly monitored by these mechanical sentries. Imperial streets are patrolled at ground level by pairs of these droids. They maintain a wide spacing to prevent both units falling prey to ambush. Despite a lack of personality programming, imperial engineers have installed profiling directives, guiding these droids to suspect wrongdoing from alien species. Humans are treated neutrally, with pureblooded Sith being ignored almost entirely.",

		"description": "The exploits of Imperial Intelligence in the fields of assassination, deception, and manipulation were infamous, but were only possible through the sheer analytical horsepower of its Watchers. Analysts and handlers, Watchers provided direction and information to agents in the field. While Watchers worked closely with fixers and cipher agents, they were supervised directly by Keeper, the operational head of Imperial Intelligence. A team of operatives, or a single Cipher Agent, would often be assigned alongside a Watcher subject matter expert as a task group. While field operatives conducting covert operations, the Watcher would provide intelligence and direct future operations on behalf of Keeper.\n\nIntelligence’s most recent cohort of Watchers benefited from enhanced cognitive abilities, the result of the Empire’s experimental eugenics program. These natural abilities were enhanced with a punishing regimen of academics and mental conditioning, creating a class of analyst that was also a biological CPU on par with conventional information processing droids. The loyalty of these enhanced Watchers was ensured by deeply implanted post-hypnotic suggestion, essentially encoding a psychological kill switch linked to a specific audiovisual stimuli capable of rendering a watcher unconscious or even comatose. The existence, let alone the nature, of this stimuli was a closely guarded secret, as that information could be used to debilitating effect on Imperial Intelligence.",
