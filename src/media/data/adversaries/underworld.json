Arms dealers have access to large amounts of weaponry and are willing to sell them to anyone, for a price. The means by which these individuals come by their stock varies wildly; some are former mercenaries, while others haunt battlefields like scavengers looking for cast-aside weap­ons instead of a meal, and still others have extensive networks of contacts within existing military organiza­tions. Regardless, these individuals are often in the mar­ket for smugglers or others who have ships of their own to transport goods to and from customers. Due to the sheer volume of firepower they have available to bring to bear if the situation requires it, it is an extremely bad idea to cross an arms dealer.",

Barabels are an intelligent species, but often seem otherwise be­ cause of their halting command of Basic and their seemingly primitive social cus­toms.

Most pirate captains fear capture, and will not take unnecessary risks unless the promise of their bounty is so great that their avarice overcomes their cowardice.",
